#Fundamentals of Vibration Analysis and Vibroacoustics - Assignments

This repository contains the code and the reports of the assignments of the course of Fundamentals of Vibration Analysis (Module A) and Vibroacoustics (Module B) held in Politecnico di Milano by professors Alfi Stefano and Corradi Roberto.

During exercise classes, students are assigned case studies on the modelling and numerical analisys of vibrating systems (Module A). 
In addition to traditional lectures, the course includes experimental and computer labs, focused on specific methodologies, case studies or practical applications (Module B). 
Students are requested to prepare short reports on the assignments to be delivered at the final exam. 

## About the course 
### Module A: Fundamentals of Vibration Analysis

This module deals with mechanical vibrations of lumped parameter systems, considering both theory and applications. First, it covers free and forced vibration of linear single-degree-of-freedom systems. It then extends this analysis to two- and multi-degree-of-freedom linear systems. Particular attention is given to frequency domain models and to the principal coordinate formulation based on modal superposition approach.
The course is held by professor Alfi Stefano.


### Module B: Vibroacoustics

The aim of the course is to introduce students to engineering methods for vibration and sound radiation analysis of continuous structures. Both analytical/numerical models and experimental techniques are covered and particular attention is given to examples and applications, especially in the field of string musical instruments. Each topic is treated theoretically and practically, through traditional lectures and experimental/computer labs.
The course is held by professor Corradi Roberto. 

The topics covered by the first module (Fundamentals of Vibration Analysis) are prerequisites to the second one (Vibroacoustics).
Experimental and computer labs are held by professor Cesare Lupo Ferrari (in both modules).
